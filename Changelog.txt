
V0.1 - Joe:
-Developed the Barcode Generator (Standalone version & version for GUI)
-Developed the Barcode Detector (Used by the Barcode Scanner)
	-Including moving the files once generated - to get rid of the clutter
	-Moves to a file in my public folder - will be updated on rollout of code
-Developed the Barcode Scanner
-Developed the first GUI rendition 
	-inluding buttons that do the barcode bits!!
	-Config menu
		- Open spreadsheet from program
-Developed the first data handler
	-Adds new barcodes to an excel spreadsheet


V0.2 - Joe:
-Deletion of first data handler
	-There are probably simpler and more suitable options
	-This can be achieved with OOP 
-Implementation of new data handler (done using pandaS)
-GUI updates, more fields for entry for barcode generation
-Barcode scanner now checks if barcodes exist/ are valid
	-When a existing barcode is scanned you can now change its data
-You can now delete barcodes from the database
- You can manually enter barcodes rather than scan them as well
- Automatic filepaths for moving the barcodes
	-Should reduce the amount of errors due to incorrect filepaths with updates
-Scanned barcodes that dont exist in the database can be added to the database post scan
	-Including manual entry
