-More modern GUI??? - Last resort lol probably PYQT - If your really really really bored 


-Barcode package has functionality for generating the barcodes as images instead
	-Possible update? although the current generation seems to be fine, might make it easier to print them in the long run



-Come up with a standard for the barcodes (i.e. numbers in set places that signify what stuff is)


-If a barcode represents a location 
	-Notice it
	-Use that to determine another barcodes location








-Data consolidation? - Not entierly necessary because once you had done something with the GUI they are then the same again
	-On bootup make sure that the data in the CSV and excel document are the same
	-If there not, copy the CSV? Or ask the user which to keep



-Choose what Pi we are doing it on
-Choose a camera (or maybe a barcode scanner) 
-Adapt code for a Pi
-Get it on the Pi - Figure out how we are going to utilise multiple ones
