-More modern GUI??? - Last resort lol probably PYQT
-Maybe popups to do with generation/scanning of barcodes?? - extra maybe
-Add new barcodes to the database automatically (along with product info)
- Decide how we are storing the data
-Come up with a standard for the barcodes (i.e. numbers in set places that signify what stuff is)
-Create barcode object - holds all the relevant data

-Once a barcode is scanned do something with the data
	-probably pandaS stuff
