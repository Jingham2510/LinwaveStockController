1) The most common failure for generating barcodes is due to having less than 12 digits in the entry box
2) DO NOT EDIT ONE BARCODE DATABASE AND NOT THE OTHER - CAN CAUSE WEIRD ISSUES 
	-Try and do all editing with the application
3) If the prgoram isnt working, first check to make sure all the path directories are correct, they will change when data is moved or the program is updated
